# Welcome to the Programming Challenges!

The purpose of this repo is to simply improve programming, whether it would be a specific language, 
improving readability, or even getting the basics of git

Here I will tell you how you can collaborate and improve your coding techniques 😄 

# Getting Started

## Dependencies
First things first! You have to make sure that your system has **git**. If you already have git on your system
then please skip to **Cloning to your system**.

### Mac
Please paste this to your terminal `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Once completed, then run `brew install git`, and voila!! You have git on your system so you can start the coding 👩‍💻 👨‍💻

## Cloning to your system
Go to the main [link](https://github.com/niroigen/programming_challenges) and follow these steps

## Step 1. 
Click the ***Clone or Download Button***

## Step 2. 
Make sure you are on the mode ***Clone with HTTPS***, then click the copy icon

## Step 3.
If you are on Mac or Linux, launch **terminal**. (Currently this wiki is only supported for those two)

## Step 4.
In the terminal enter `cd`, then type `git clone ` followed by the **url** which you just **copied**

## Step 5.
If all went well and you type `ls` on your terminal, you should see `programming_challenges` there! 🎊
